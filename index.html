		<h1>Libations Abound</h1>
		<p>Ideas and recipes for handmade cocktails you can actually make at home.</p>

		<h3>About this site</h3>
		<blockquote>
						<p>I provide here only a selection. A complete account of all known drinks, from absinthe to the Zoom cocktail (brandy, honey and cream&mdash;not today, thank you) would be deadening to write and read. Completeness would also involve the rehearsal of a good deal of common knowledge. It would be rather shabby to take money for explaining that, for instance, a gin and tonic consists of gin and tonic, plus ice and a slice of lemon. However, this gives me the occasion to remark that that admittedly excellent and refreshing drink gains an extra thirst-quenching tang from a good squeeze of lemon juice in addition to the lemon slice and so to propound a general principle: <em>any drink traditionally accompanied by a bit of fruit or vegetable is worth trying with a spot of the juice thrown in as well.</em>. </p>
						<p>I confine myself, then, to giving recipes intended to offer something of my own, whether it be a modest tip like one exemplified above, an atack on some received notion, or, as in some cases, a whole new formula&mdash;if there is any such thing in a field so extensively and intensively studied.</p>

		<h3>
			Gibson
		</h3>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>2 oz</em> gin
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>&frac12; oz</em> dry vermouth
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Stir over ice, serve ice cold in a martini glass, garnish with a cocktail onion. This simple variant of the martini was almost certainly invented at many cocktail parties when the host realized he had forgotten to buy olives, and even once in a dorm room with slices of red onion from the fridge. &sect; My favorite tale is of a shrewd investment banker named Montgomery Gibson, would took his clients out to a three-martini lunch and have the barman fill his glass with ice cold water.

		<h3>
			Tom Collins
		</h3>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>1.5 oz</em> gin
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>1 oz</em> fresh lemon juice
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>1 tablespoon</em> simple syrup
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>2.5 oz</em> fizzy water
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A Tom Collins is just a Gin Fizz with a fancy name. Some people use Collins mix, but what you&rsquo;d buy at the store is just lemon juice from concentrate mixed with a little sugar and carbonated. To make one at home, mix the ingredients above in a Collins glass&mdash;some people insist on exactly two ice cubes, but don&rsquo;t be one of those people.

	<h3>
		Gimlet
	</h3>
	<div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>2 oz</em> gin
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>2 oz</em> Rose&rsquo;s sweetened lime juice
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Serve in an old fashioned glass with ice. A favorite of Raymond Chandler, who insisted that &ldquo;a Gimlet is half gin and half Rose&rsquo;s, and nothing else.&rdquo; The recipe above is his.

	<h3>
		Gin &amp; Tonic
	</h3>
	<div>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>2 oz</em> gin
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>3 oz</em> tonic water
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Mix in an old fashioned glass with ice. Add lime as a garnish to taste. The gin and tonic is a drink that I have not yet mastered; a friend of mine makes them using a combination of guesswork, approximation, and luck. He admonishes me to &ldquo;add stuff until it tastes good,&rdquo; which is good advice for all sorts of things.

<!--Whiskey-->		
		<h2>Whiskey</h2>
		
			<h3>
				Rusty Nail
			</h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> Scotch whiskey
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>&frac12; oz</em> Drambuie
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Build and stir in an old fashioned glass with ice. Mellow, sipped in the suburbs, John Cheever&rsquo;s favorite drink. Has an aura of the swinger about it.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>
			Highball
		</h3>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>1.5 oz</em> Jack Daniel&rsquo;s Tennessee whiskey
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>glassful</em> ginger ale
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Mix the two in a chilled highball glass, ice recommended but by no means mandatory. The original highball.
		</p>
	</div>
<!--Rum-->	
	<h2>Rum</h2>
				
			<h3>
				Dark &amp; Stormy
			</h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>1.5 oz</em> Gosling&rsquo;s Black Seal rum
				</li>
				<li>Bermuda ginger beer <em>to fill</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Pour the rum over ice in an old-fashioned glass, then pour in ginger beer to taste. You shouldn&rsquo;t use Jamaican ginger beer, as it has a somewhat sharp taste without any citrus. Related to the Highball (Jack Daniels and ginger ale) and just as delicious on hot summer nights.
			</p>
		</div>
		
<!--Campari-->		
		
		<h2>Campari</h2>
	   
			<h3>
				Campari &amp; Soda
			</h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>3 oz</em> Campari
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>3 oz</em> sparkling water
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A personal favorite&mdash;anything with Campari is&mdash;during the summer. I use San Pelligrino, but there&rsquo;s no reason you have to.
			</p>

				Negroni
			</h3>
			<div>
			<p>This sublime cocktail is of unknown origin. To make it, mix</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> Campari
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> gin
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> sweet red vermouth
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>over ice and stir till quite cold. Cut a thin sliver from the peel of an orange for a twist. Serve either in a stemmed glass (to a woman) or on the rocks (for a man) with or without the twist in the drink.</p>
			
			<h4>Variations</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Double or treble the amounts</li>
				<li>Try a little less vermouth and a little more gin.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h3>
			Campari Orange
		</h3>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>6&nbsp;cL</em> Campari
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>18&nbsp;cL</em> orange juice
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Pour into a highball glass filled with ice. This drink looks and tastes like grapefruit juice when stirred, but if you pour the Campari in first, then the orange juice in gently, it forms a red&ndash;orange gradient that is rather pretty.
		</p>
	</div>
		
<!--Vodka-->
		
<h2>Vodka</h2>		
		<img src="greyhound.jpg">
		<h3>
			Greyhound
		</h3>
		<div>
		<p>A simple and delicious drink that could just as easily be called gin and juice. Most cocktail books instruct you to salt the rim of a Greyhound. I don't care for it.
		</p>
		<p>Fill a highball glass halfway with ice. Add</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>2 oz</em> vodka
			</li>
			<li>grapefruit juice <em>as desired</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Stir till quite cold.
		</p>
		<h4>Variations</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Use gin instead of vodka.</li>
			<li>Use almost any kind of fruit juice. Pineapple, apple, lemonade, limeade.</li>
			<li>Stir over ice then pour in to a chilled cocktail glass for a fancier presentation.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			Screwdriver
		</h3>
		<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>2 oz</em> vodka
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>5 oz</em> fresh orange juice
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Mix ingredients in a highball glass, with or without ice. Drink a toast to Truman Capote, who called it &ldquo;my orange drink,&rdquo; and have another.
		</p>
	</div>
	
		
			<h3>
				White Russian
			</h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>2 oz</em> vodka
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> kahlua
				</li>
				<li>milk
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Mix ingredients in an old fashioned glass over ice. An excellent choice for relaxation, especially over cards before bedtime. Some recipes call for cream or half and half, but the Dude made his with milk, and the Dude abides.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		
		
<!--Tequila-->
<h2>Tequila</h2>		
			<h3>
				Margarita
			</h3>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>1.5 oz</em> tequila
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>1 oz</em> triple sec
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>0.5 oz</em> fresh lime juice
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Shake over crushed ice and pour over ice in an old fashioned glass. Add a lime wheel. If you want to forget you&rsquo;re drinking alcohol, use half as much triple sec and twice as much lime. Salting the rim of the glass is tantamount to admitting that you used inferior tequila and that you are trying to cover it up.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h2>Beer</h2>
		
		<img src="bmonkey.jpg" alt="bmonkey" width="" height="" />
	<h3>Brass Monkey</h3>
	<div>
	<ul>
		<p>
	The traditional way of making this beverage is to take a 40 oz malt liquor and drink down to the top of the label, and pour in some orange juice. The traditional garnish for this version of this beverage would be duct taped to your hand until you finish.
	</p>
	<p>Another way of creating this beverage is to fill a pint glass with ice, as desired. Add </p>
	
	<li><em>12 oz </em> beer of your choosing</li>
	<li><em>4 oz </em>fresh orange juice</li>
	
	<p>Stir until well mixed. </p>

			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>12 oz</em> Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>3 oz</em> Bombay Sapphire
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Pour the Pale Ale and Bombay into a chilled highball glass. This drink is named for its effects.
